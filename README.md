# Morse Code Translator 🔤

**An Innovative Approach to Secure Morse Code Communication**  

This project is a Morse code translator developed using a **binary tree structure**, designed as part of my Milestone 2 assignment for the database and datastructure module. It efficiently encodes and decodes messages, utilizing a binary tree that maps each letter to its corresponding Morse code sequence. A unique **reversal feature** adds an extra layer of security, making decoding more challenging and secure.

## 🌟 Features

### **Binary Tree Structure**
- Maps characters to Morse code using left (dot) and right (dash) node traversal.
- Enables efficient and accurate encoding and decoding.

### **Reversal Security**
- Adds an additional obfuscation layer by reversing the code sequence before/after translation.
- Enhances security, making the encoded message harder to decode without the correct algorithm.

### **Optimized for Performance**
- Provides efficient lookups and translations, making it suitable for secure communication applications.

## 📖 Usage
1. **Encoding Messages**:  
   - Input a text message to convert it into its Morse code equivalent.  
   - Optionally, enable the reversal feature for added security.  

2. **Decoding Messages**:  
   - Provide a Morse code sequence to retrieve the original message.  
   - For reversed sequences, enable the reversal option before decoding.
