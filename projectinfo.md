Morse Code Translator with Binary Tree and Reversal Security    
This project is a powerful Morse code translator built using a binary tree structure, offering an efficient solution for encoding and decoding messages in Morse code. Originally developed for the Kielstone 2 assignment, it goes beyond basic translation by incorporating a reversal feature to enhance security, making the decoding process more complex and secure.

Project Highlights
Binary Tree Structure: Leverages a binary tree to represent Morse code, where each letter is mapped by traversing left (for dots) and right (for dashes). This structure allows for quick encoding and decoding operations.

Reversal Security: Adds a layer of security by reversing Morse code sequences, which obfuscates the encoding and adds an additional challenge to decoding. This technique provides basic encryption, making it ideal for secure communication applications.

Optimized Performance: The binary tree design ensures fast lookups and streamlined translation, making it efficient and scalable for large messages.

Features
Encode Text to Morse Code: Converts standard text into Morse code by traversing the binary tree nodes.
Decode Morse Code to Text: Translates Morse code back into readable text, with an option to reverse sequences for added security.
Reversal Obfuscation: An optional feature that reverses Morse sequences, adding a unique security layer to your communications.
